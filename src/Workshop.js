      I teach mini lessons along with small group instructions to provide
      differentiated support. Students work with partners and help each other
      during the writing process and are given regular and immediate feedback.
      Students are always writing to an authentic audience and I provide them
      with multiple ways to publish their writing: type or voice type on google
      doc, make a video, or use ChatterPic.
